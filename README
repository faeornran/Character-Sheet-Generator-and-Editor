Apologies for the lack of comments, this was something I wanted to hack together to make very quickly.

More work will be coming.  I will probably switch over to using jQuery some time in the future, but I didn't feel like learning it this weekend and just wanted to have this thing done.

I hate IE, so I didn't bother to add any compatibility for it.  If it miraculously works somehow, then great!  Otherwise, you have been warned that it was not at all tested nor developed for.

As far as compatibility with other browsers go, I have tested this with Chrome and Firefox and it works fine in both.

To install:
Copy the files in a folder that is in the same directory as your phpbb forum's root folder.  Alternatively, change the appropriate phpbb_* scripts to point to the right place.  Once you do that, create a templates subfolder and you should be set.

To use templatemaker.php:
Play around with the buttons.  Size affects only textboxes and lists. Click and drag everything around, including the menu.  Anything added gets added directly under the menu.

For both templatemaker.php and charsheet.php:
Saving is only enabled if a person is logged into the phpbb forum.  Loading is enabled for everyone.

Standard load: Type the name of the file (IE, the file name before the file extension) and hit enter when logged in.  This doesn't work if you're not logged in.

Otherwise, you can load files from other user's accounts even if logged out, and see their templates and character sheets.  Type <username>/<filename> to access a particular user's documents.  Again, don't include the extension of the filename.

All non a-zA-Z0-9 characters are stripped from the filenames when being saved. 
All non a-zA-Z0-9 characters and non / characters are removed when being loaded.

If something breaks, please let me know!

Cheers,

-James
